# ZeyOS REST API [draft]

The ZeyOS Library REST API (or ZeyOS REST API) provides access to almost all of your ZeyOS data and gives you a powerful tool to connect third-party applications and other systems with ZeyOS, without having to write a custom ZeyOS app.

The REST API currently consists of two function groups:
- Authentication and session management
- Data access and data manipulation

Using a query language based on SQL, you can extract data from and manipulate data in your ZeyOS database, including simple table JOINs.

For more sophisticated tasks you can also use the [ZeyOS Core API and ZeyOS Library](http://www.zymba.info/] to build custom apps and web services for [ZeyOS](https://developer.zeyos.com/) and even deploy them to ZeyOS users via [ZeyConnect](https://www.zeyconnect.com/).

## Versioning Policy

The API is versioned with a **major** and a **minor version number**, making up the API **version number**.

The major version number may be increased along with the ZeyOS major version if there are semantic changes, while the minor version number may be increased when ZeyOS internals affecting the REST API change while keeping the same ZeyOS version number.

**Within the _same major and minor version number_, we reserve the right to _add_ HTTP headers, new parameters or new API endpoints (a.k.a. routes) _without_ breaking backwards compatibility and to _fix privilege escalation and any data leak issues_ (which _may_ break compatibility if you rely on access to otherwise inaccessible data), which is in _contrast_ to semantic versioning.**

We will however **not** change **documented semantics** of endpoints, HTTP headers, request parameters specified in the URI query string or the request body for routes from the point on they are **first made public and documented**.

While the REST API may stay the same, the underlying ZeyOS database itself _may_ change its schema on rare occasions (e.g. table or column changes, changes of type identifiers), thereby potentially breaking the REST API indirectly.

If this happens, the broken REST API version will be _phased out_, unless restoring compatibility through internal API code changes is deemed feasible, at our discretion.

All REST API versions **will stay** for as long as there are **no adverse availability-, security- or data-loss-related issues** and **no semantic or database schema changes**.

**Exceptions can be made to maintain or restore availability of ZeyOS, to mitigate attacks or to fix other critical security and data loss situations.**

Any other _incompatible_ changes to the REST API or to ZeyOS will be accompanied by a _new_ REST API version.

We will update our corresponding GitHub repositories to document pending changes several _weeks in advance_ whenever possible to give you time to update your systems and apps to prevent breakage and downtime.

We will also provide migration guides to help you transition to newer REST API versions.

## HTTP Verbs

The REST API uses HTTP verbs according to the intended operation.

| Verb   | Description         |
| ------ | ------------------- |
| DELETE | Delete data         |
| GET    | Read data           |
| HEAD   | Check for existence |
| POST   | Update data         |
| PUT    | Create data         |

Depending on the requested resource, not all methods may be available.
For example, `/api/1.0/tags` supports `DELETE`, `GET`, `HEAD` and `PUT`, but not `POST` because tags can be removed, fetched, checked to exist and be created not be updated.

Sometimes it may not be possible to use the proper HTTP verb, for example because you are sending a request from an HTML form or use a restricted HTTP client.

For such cases, the REST API will check any `POST` request for an `X-HTTP-Method-Override` header or a `__method` form variable that specifies the actual intended verb, in that order, and use the first non-empty value to route the request.

## Return Values and Error Handling

The REST API currently only returns JSON data and an HTTP status code indicating the outcome of a request.

HTTP status code 200 is used to indicate a successful response, and the result will be an object with a `result` property as its only member.

```json
{"result":true}
```

When an error occurs, the HTTP status code will be outside the range of 200 - 399, and the JSON response will be an object with an `error` property with an error message.

```json
{"error":"System is in maintenance mode. Please try again later."}
```

We recommend that you treat any response which does not represent a valid JSON object, does not contain the `result` property or has an `error` property, or any HTTP status code outside the 200 - 399 range as an error.

HTTP status codes commonly used by the REST API to indicate failures:

|  Code | Reason                               |
| ----- | ------------------------------------ |
|  200  | No errors.                           |
|  201  | An object was created.               |
|  400  | Generic error / bad request.         |
|  401  | Unauthorized.                        |
|  403  | Access forbidden / permission denied.|
|  404  | Requested resource cannot be found.  |
|  409  | Conflict with an existing resource.  |
|  410  | Resource is gone.                    |
|  500  | Generic error, no details available. |
|  501  | Function not implemented.            |

## Authentication and Session Management

Authentication is based on ZeyOS's token authentication mechanism, which is also exposed to [Zymba](http://www.zymba.info/docs/ZeyOS.TokenAuth/#validate) and [iXML](http://www.ixmldev.com/docs#auth:validate).

Tokens are linked to *identifiers* which should be specific to both the accessing app and device.
This allows devices to renew their tokens independently.

To obtain a new token (and invalidate any previous token for an identifier), call the REST API URI `/api/1.0/auth` using `PUT` or `POST` and specify the user name, password and the app / device identifier as described below.

Token authentication works by including the `Zeyos-Api-Token` header in your request with the identifier, followed by a colon `:` and the obtained token string, as the value, e.g. `Zeyos-Api-Token: com.example.myapp.dev1138:2a3e4ec88e66138253a69da3406841fccb1c998e`.

## Data Access and Data Manipulation

Database table rows can be loaded by performing a `GET` with the table name and the database record ID as the path, e.g. `GET /api/1.0/notes/1`.

This will return a JSON-encoded object with the record's columns as properties of the `result` sub-object:

```json
{
    "result": {
        "ID": "1",
        "owneruser": null,
        "ownergroup": null,
        "creator": null,
        "assigneduser": null,
        "creationdate": "1406564511",
        "lastmodified": "1406564511",
        "visibility": "0",
        "name": "To Do",
        "status": "0",
        "text": "Document API",
        "contenttype": "text\/plain",
        "size": "0",
        "binfile": "189330609"
    }
}
```

To load all notes (up to the REST API's internal limit, or to a limit specified with `n=...`, whichever is less), simply omit the ID: `GET /api/1.0/notes`.

If you also want to load extensional data (_"extdata"_), add a `GET` parameter `extdata=1`.
This will include a sub-object `extdata` for each returned object.

To create a record, send a `PUT` request with with the record's data.

Records are updated by sending a `POST` request with data to update.
Data can either be specified as URL-encoded form variables in the `POST` body or as JSON.

`PUT` and `POST` may specify data either in URL-encoded form (`Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, e.g. `name=ACME&city=New+York`) or as JSON (`Content-Type: application/json`).

Unspecified values will not be modified.
In the case of `PUT`, this means that such values will be initialized with their default values as specified in the database table definition (if `creationdate` and `lastmodified` columns are unspecified, the REST API will fill them with the current date and time).

When using URL-encoding, values are specified as strings and will be converted automatically by the database to the columns' data types, therefore `name=` _(empty)_ would assign the empty string to `name`.

In order to specify NULL values, the REST API introduces a special notation with a prefixed minus sign `-`, e.g. `-name=`.
Note that in this case, any value supplied after the equal `=` character will be ignored.

To add or update extensional data, `extdata` fields may be specified in an `extdata` sub-object, i.e. as a URL-encoded HTTP form variable `extdata[<name>]=<string-value>` (in the request body), or as JSON as shown below:

```json
{
    "name": "My Record",
    "extdata": {
        "iban" : "BE62 5100 0754 7061",
        "count": 25,
        "valid": true
    }
}
```

Any previously existing extdata values will be overwritten with the new values.

Unspecified extdata values however remain untouched unless you also specify a form variable or top-level JSON object property `-extdata=` to remove all existing values.

Specifying `-extdata=` without later supplying any `extdata` fields will remove all extensional data.

When an entity record is created or updated, a "monitor" record (a log entry in the `records` table with `flag` set to `3`; see [ZeyOS schema documentation](http://schema.zeyos.com/)) will be created, unless you specify the URI query parameter `monitor=0`.

`PUT` requests on tags will yield `true` if the tag was linked to the specified entity.

`PUT` requests on database tables / entities will return the database record ID, i.e. the created row's primary key while `POST` requests will return `true` on success.

If you instead want to get the updated record after such a `PUT` or `POST`, specify a URI query parameter `object=1`, e.g. `POST /myplatform/api/1.0/accounts/42?object=1`.
This can be combined with the `extdata` flag to retrieve associated extensional data at the same time.

## Database Tables with Visibility Flag

Please note that this API provides low-level access to database records in the sense that `DELETE` operations will actually invoke an SQL `DELETE` regardless of any `visibility` table column.

If you want to soft-delete or archive a record on a table with a `visibility` column, set the column to the proper value mark the record as (soft-)deleted or archived.

| Visibility Flag | Description    |
| --------------- | -------------- |
|        0        | Regular object |
|        1        | Archived       |
|        2        | Soft-deleted   |

Please refer to the [ZeyOS Schema documentation](http://schema.zeyos.com/) for tables with a `visibility` flag (in the [_Columns_ section](http://schema.zeyos.com/columns.byColumn.html#columns).

## SQL via REST

The REST API exposes the ZeyOS Library's SQL query builder API, giving developers simple access to ZeyOS data.

Let's start with an example, searching for a text note where the name is `Vacation` or which contains the text `Jul`, followed by `2014` (e.g. `Jul 2014` or `July 28, 2014`):

```
GET /api/1.0/notes
?a=n
&s=["n.text"]
&w[]=or
&w[]=["name", "Vacation"]
&w[]=["text","Jul%2014","ILIKE"]
&w[]=["text"]
&w[]=ea
&o[]=lastmodified
&o[]=creationdate-
&n=100
&i=200
```

Other than querying for rows, it is also possible to determine the row count with `q=c` or to obtain the SQL statement via `q=s`.

| Parameter |  Type       | Description                              | Example                 |
| --------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `a`       | string      | Alias                                    | `a=note`                |
| `d`       | string      | DISTINCT                                 | `d=`                    |
| `s`       | string/json | SELECT (see below)                       | `s[]=ID`                |
| `m`       | string/json | Case-insensitive text search (see below) | `m=Anna`                |
| `w`       | string/json | WHERE (see below)                        | `w[]=["name","Holiday"] |
| `j`       | string/json | JOIN (see below)                         | `j[]=["contact"]        |
| `g`       | string      | GROUP BY; name of column to group by     | `g[]=name`              |
| `o`       | string      | ORDER BY; column name plus optional "+"  for ascending, "-" for descending order and "F" / "L" for `NULLS FIRST` / `NULLS LAST` | `o[]=creationdate- |
| `n`       | int         | LIMIT                                    | `n=25`                  |
| `i`       | int         | OFFSET                                   | `i=100`                 |
| `q`       | string      | Query: `c` for `COUNT`, `s` for the SQL  | `q=s`                   |
| `x`       | bool        | Set to `1` (or `true` when using JSON) to obtain numerically indexed columns (default: associative keys). | `x=1`                 |


### SELECT parameters

`SELECT` columns are given as `s[<index>]=<column>` or `s[<index>]=[<column>, <alias>]`, where `index` may be omitted (it will be inferred automatically from the order the columns are specified).

Examples:

```
s[]=ID
s[0]=text
s[]=["postalcode","pc"]
```

### Case-Insensitive Text Search

The REST API exposes a search function which behaves like the search text boxes in ZeyOS, performing a search for all supplied terms.

For example, the query `m=Hello+world` (`+` denotes a URL-encoded space) on the `appointments` table basically creates this `WHERE` condition:
```
(
    (
        LOWER("name") LIKE '%hello%' OR
        LOWER("location") LIKE '%hello%'
    ) AND (
        LOWER("name") LIKE '%world%' OR
        LOWER("location") LIKE '%world%'
    )
)
```

The search runs on pre-defined columns specific to each table that are likely to be shared among few rows only, e.g. a name, an identifier or a transaction number column.

You can find a list of considered columns in the parameter documentation for the list API call of each table.

Terms are broken up when space (whitespace) characters are encountered; to specify terms with spaces, double quotes `"` may be used, e.g. `m="Hello+world"`.

### WHERE

`WHERE` conditions must be specified as JSON: `w[<index>]=[<column>, <value>, <operator>]`, where `<index>`, `<value>` and `<operator>` are optional and may be omitted.

There are special "conditions" to create sub-conditions, namely `and` and `or`:

```
w[]=and
w[]=or
```

Both start a sub-condition which must be closed with `el` (end level) or `ea` (end all).
`el` closes the currently open sub-condition while `ea` closes all sub-conditions.

You can think of `and` / `or` to be equivalent to opening parentheses `(` and the respective conjunction / disjunction within the sub-condition and `el` to correspond to a closing parenthesis `)`.

Consequently, `ea` is a shortcut for as many `el` clauses as necessary to terminate all open sub-conditions.

Currently, the following operators are supported for `WHERE` (aliases may be used in place of the specified operator):

| Operator      | SQL Equivalent                     | Example                          | Aliases           |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `n`           | `<column> IS NULL`                 | `["record",null,"n"]`            | `NULL`            |
| `nn`          | `<column> IS NOT NULL`             | `["record",null,"nn"]`           | `NOT_NULL`        |
| `=`           | `<column> = <value>`               | `["company","Zeyon","="]`        | `EQUAL` (default, can be omitted) |
| `!=`          | `<column> <> <value>`              | `["ID",5,"!="]`                  | `NOT_EQUAL`       |
| `ge`          | `<column> >= <value>`              | `["amount",100.00,"ge"]`         | `GREATER_EQUAL`   |
| `gt`          | `<column> > <value>`               | `["amount",100.00,"gt"]`         | `GREATER_THAN`    |
| `le`          | `<column> <= <value>`              | `["amount",100.00,"le"]`         | `LESS_EQUAL`      |
| `lt`          | `<column> < <value>`               | `["amount",100.00,"lt"]`         | `LESS_THAN`       |
| `in`          | `<column> IN <value>`              | `["status",[0,1],"in"]`          | `IN`              |
| `ni`          | `<column> NOT IN <value>`          | `["status",[5,6],"ni"]`          | `NOT_IN`          |
| `b`           | `<column> BETWEEN <a> AND <b>`     | `["status",[0,4],"b"]`           | `BETWEEN`         |
| `nb`          | `<column> NOT BETWEEN <a> AND <b>` | `["status",[5,9],"nb"]`          | `NOT_BETWEEN`     |
| `LIKE`        | `<column> LIKE <value>`            | `["text","%Jack%","LIKE"]`       |                   |
| `ILIKE`       | `<column> ILIKE <value>`           | `["text","%christmas%","ILIKE"]` |                   |

The operators `=` and `!=` will also handle `null` and array values properly.
The following conditions on the left- and right-hand sides are equivalent:

```
["record",null,"n"]      ["record",null]
["record",null,"nn"]     ["record",null,"!="]
["status",[0,1],"in"]    ["status",[0,1]]
["status",[5,6],"ni"]    ["status",[5,6],"!="]
```

For example, the SQL condition `WHERE (a = 1 OR b = 'x')` would be written as

```
w[]=or                     #  (, use "OR"
w[]=["a",1]                #      a = 1
w[]=["b","x"]              #      b = 'x'
w[]=el                     #  )
```

A more complex example:

```sql
WHERE
    (creationdate >= 1234567890) AND
    (
        (company ILIKE 'Zeyon Tech%' AND country = 'CA') OR
        (company = 'Zeyon GmbH & Co. KG' AND country = 'DE')
    )
```

becomes

```
w[]=and                                           # (, use "AND"
  w[]=["creationdate",1234567890,"ge"]            #   (creationdate >= 1234567890)
  w[]=or                                          #   (, use "OR"
    w[]=and                                       #     (, use "AND"
      w[]=["company","Zeyon Tech%","ILIKE"]       #       company ILIKE 'Zeyon Tech%'
      w[]=["country","CA"]                        #       country = 'CA'
      w[]=el                                      #     )
    w[]=and                                       #     (, use "AND"
      w[]=["company","Zeyon GmbH & Co. KG"]       #       company = 'Zeyon GmbH & Co. KG'
      w[]=["country","DE"]                        #       country = 'DE'
w[]=ea                                            # )))
```

In a real query, we would then need to URL-encode the query parameters to get this:

```
w%5B%5D=and&
w%5B%5D=%5B%22creationdate%22%2C1234567890%2C%22ge%22%5D&
w%5B%5D=or&
w%5B%5D=and&
w%5B%5D=%5B%22company%22%2C%22Zeyon%20Tech%25%22%2C%22ILIKE%22%5D&
w%5B%5D=%5B%22country%22%2C%22CA%22%5D&
w%5B%5D=el&
w%5B%5D=and&
w%5B%5D=%5B%22company%22%2C%22Zeyon%20GmbH%20%26%20Co.%20KG%22%5D&
w%5B%5D=%5B%22country%22%2C%22DE%22%5D&
w%5B%5D=ea
```

### JOIN

For security reasons and simplicity, the REST API limits SQL JOINs to a subset of *"managed" JOINs* on tables related to the main table you are querying.

Managed JOINs are defined by specifying the foreign key column, optionally together with the table name, the JOIN type (`INNER` for `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT` for `OUTER LEFT JOIN`) and an alias for the joined table.

        j[]=[<column>, <table>, <join type>, <alias>]

For example, if we were to query the `accounts` table and wanted to JOIN it with its assigned `contacts` record via `accounts.contact`, we would use

```
GET /api/1.0/accounts
?j[]=["contact"]
```

Using the `JOIN`, we could use any column from the `contacts` table to limit our search:

```
GET /api/1.0/accounts
    ?j[]=["contact"]
    &w[]=["contacts.company","Zeyon Technologies, Inc."]
```

# Group Record Numbers

Most tables have a [numformat](http://www.zymba.info/docs/ZeyOS.NumFormat/) column named `...num` that is unique across the ZeyOS database and which serves as a secondary _logical_ record identifier, meaning that it _should_ &ndash; but need not &ndash; be unique within its database table.

For example, the `tasks` table's numformat column is `tasknum`, and `projects` table has a `projectnum` column.
The `accounts` table as a special case has two numformat columns, `customernum` and `suppliernum`, because it can hold both customers and suppliers.
Accounts of customers and prospects will have the `customernum` set automatically on save, while suppliers will have the `suppliernum` column set, and supplier-customers will have both numformat columns set.
Competitor accounts will auto-fill none of those columns.

The corresponding format string to render the numformat value is defined in the [system configuration](#reference/configuration) in a sub-object `numformat` which maps the numformat column name to the format string, e.g.

```json
{
    ...
    "numformat": {
        "tasknum": "\\T.X5"
    }
    ...
}
```

The example above produces a `tasknum` value starting with a literal `T`, followed by the auto-incremented numformat counter formatted to 5 digits, e.g. `T.00042`.

The counter is not transaction-safe, though: It is increased immediately upon a successful save, regardless of any wrapping transaction.
That is, even a transaction that is rolled back after the save will not change the fact that the counter is increased when the save in itself was successful.

Please note that as the counter value is read _before_ incrementing and then incremented on save, there is a very small chance that two concurrent saves yield two records with the _same_ numformat value.
This behavior is consistent with how ZeyOS itself saves and increments the counter, and is for technical and performance reasons.

You can look up numformat columns in the [ZeyOS database schema documentation](http://schema.zeyos.com/).

# Group Batch Requests

## Specifying Commands

Performing multiple requests one at a time requires multiple network round-trips and consumes more resources, making them slow and expensive.

Therefore, ZeyOS exposes a REST API route for batch requests to which you can bundle and send multiple requests for processing and retrieve the results upon completion.

A batch request is specified as an _array of commands_ (a **command block**) and should be sent in JSON form using the `Content-Type: application/json` request header.
Alternatively, you could also send batch requests as URL-encoded `POST` data, although this is not recommended.

By default, the result of a batch request is the outcome of the _last command_ in the batch, but you can also obtain other or all results by using special commands.

Commands can be **assignments**, **settings**, **requests** or **entire command blocks**, i.e. command blocks are _nestable_.

Settings that accept a boolean `true` or `false` will default to `true` when the _value is unspecified_.
They are _not_ inherited by nested command blocks and will default to `false` when the _setting is not specified_ at all.

**All commands return a result.**
Settings will return the _setting's value_ after the assignment.

When a batch request is run, a result block will be assembled to store the results of each executed command, using the _same index_ that is used for the corresponding command.

The result of a _command block_ is the result of the block's _last command_.

Currently, the following commands are recognized:

### Assignments

- `=<ref-string>`
  Returns a string assembled according to `<ref-string>`.
  This may contain references to results previously obtained in the form `{{<ref>}}`.
  For a literal `{`, prepend it with a backslash, i.e. `\{`.
  However, you only need to backslash-escape if you have two consecutive opening curly braces `{{`, and only the first brace, i.e. `\{{` is sufficient.

- `all`
  Returns all results from the previously executed commands and stores that as a result.

- `resolve=<ref>`
  Returns the resolved result reference. See the next section for details on result references.

### Settings

- `dry_run[=true|false]`
  If `true`, ZeyOS requests will not be executed, and the parsed command will be returned instead.

- `resume_on_fail[=true|false]`
  If set to `true`, batch execution will proceed even if an error occurs, and the failed commands will yield an object with an `error` property as they do for regular requests.
  When using this setting, transactions must be disabled or be confined to a nested command block below the current block.

- `transaction[=true|false]`
  Enables or disables database transactions for all subsequent commands in the command block until this setting is changed again.

  Within an enabled transaction, _all_ changes by commands in it that access the database will become effective and visible _only if and after_ all database-accessing commands have succeeded.
  If _any one_ command fails, all subsequent commands in the transaction _will also fail_ when they access the database, and all transactional changes will be _rolled back_ after the last executed command in the transactional sequence.

### Requests

A request is given as an object with at least a `path` property.

An HTTP method may be specified in the `verb` property and will default to `GET` if omitted.
An object of URL query parameters can be supplied via `query`, and form variables as sent by a `POST` request can be supplied via `body`, also as an object.

For example, the request `GET /records?n=2&o[]=lastmodified-` would be equivalent to:

```json
{
    "verb" : "GET",              // Default, may be omitted
    "path" : "/records",
    "query": {
        "n": 2,
        "o": [
            "lastmodified-"
        ]
    }
}
```

## Referencing Results

As mentioned in the previous section, several commands allow access to previous results by specifying their position in the batch request.

Positions, _paths_ or _path references_ are a bit similar to file system directory paths or XPath specifications.
In fact, we use a (forward) slash `/` to separate path components.

A component addresses an element relative to the current command block.

A command block is numerically indexed, from index 0 to _n_ - 1 if the block consists of _n_ commands.
Therefore within a block, `3` refers to the result of the command at index `3`, which is the _fourth_ element in the block.

Parent blocks are accessible as `..`, so `../0` refers to the very first result in the parent block.

The top-level (root) command block can be accessed by specifying a sufficient number of `../`, or by a `/` at the very beginning of the path, e.g. `/2`.

If a result is an object, an array or a string, a sub-element of it may be addressed by its respective key / index.
For example, the property `name` of an object (in JSON terminology) `../2/5` is accessible as `../2/5/result/name`.

Invalid references will produce error objects `{ "error": ... }`.

Scrum has not only reinforced the interest in project management,[citation needed] but also challenged the conventional ideas about such management. Scrum focuses on project management institutions where it is difficult to plan ahead. Mechanisms of empirical process control, where feedback loops that constitute the core management technique are used as opposed to traditional command-and-control oriented management.[citation needed] It represents a radically new approach for planning and managing projects, bringing decision-making authority to the level of operation properties and certainties.[1]\r\n\r\nScrum as applied to product development was first referred to in \"New New Product Development Game\"[2] (Harvard Business Review 86116:137�146, 1986) and later elaborated in \"The Knowledge Creating Company\"[3] both by Ikujiro Nonaka and Hirotaka Takeuchi (Oxford University Press, 1995).

It is a multi-paradigm language, supporting object-oriented,[5] imperative, and functional[1][6] programming styles.\r\n\r\nJavaScript was formalized in the ECMAScript language standard and is primarily used in the form of client-side JavaScript, implemented as part of a Web browser in order to create enhanced user interfaces and dynamic websites. This enables programmatic access to computational objects within a host environment.\r\n\r\nJavaScript's use in applications outside Web pages' for example in PDF documents, site-specific browsers, and desktop widgets is also significant. Newer and faster JavaScript VMs and frameworks built upon them (notably Node.js) have also increased the popularity of JavaScript for server-side web applications.\r\n\r\nJavaScript uses syntax influenced by that of C. JavaScript copies many names and naming conventions from Java, but the two languages are otherwise unrelated and have very different semantics. The key design principles within JavaScript are taken from the Self and Scheme programming languages.[7]\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Javascript",

                    "text": "The V-model[2] represents a software development process (also applicable to hardware development) which may be considered an extension of the waterfall model. Instead of moving down in a linear way, the process steps are bent upwards after the coding phase, to form the typical V shape. The V-Model demonstrates the relationships between each phase of the development life cycle and its associated phase of testing. The horizontal and vertical axes represents time or project completeness (left-to-right) and level of abstraction (coarsest-grain abstraction uppermost), respectively.\r\n\r\nRequirements analysis\r\n\r\nIn the Requirements analysis phase, the first step in the verification process, the requirements of the proposed system are collected by analyzing the needs of the user(s). This phase is concerned with establishing what the ideal system has to perform. However it does not determine how the software will be designed or built. Usually, the users are interviewed and a document called the user requirements document is generated.\r\nThe user requirements document will typically describe the system's functional, interface, performance, data, security, etc. requirements as expected by the user. It is used by business analysts to communicate their understanding of the system to the users. The users carefully review this document as this document would serve as the guideline for the system designers in the system design phase. The user acceptance tests are designed in this phase. See also Functional requirements. this is parallel processing\r\nThere are different methods for gathering requirements of both soft and hard methodologies including; interviews, questionnaires, document analysis, observation, throw-away prototypes, use cases and status and dynamic views with users.\r\n\r\nSystem design\r\n\r\nSystems design is the phase where system engineers analyze and understand the business of the proposed system by studying the user requirements document. They figure out possibilities and techniques by which the user requirements can be implemented. If any of the requirements are not feasible, the user is informed of the issue. A resolution is found and the user requirement document is edited accordingly.\r\nThe software specification document which serves as a blueprint for the development phase is generated. This document contains the general system organization, menu structures, data structures etc. It may also hold example business scenarios, sample windows, reports for the better understanding. Other technical documentation like entity diagrams, data dictionary will also be produced in this phase. The documents for system testing are prepared in this phase.\r\n\r\nArchitecture design\r\n\r\nThe phase of the design of computer architecture and software architecture can also be referred to as high-level design. The baseline in selecting the architecture is that it should realize all which typically consists of the list of modules, brief functionality of each module, their interface relationships, dependencies, database tables, architecture diagrams, technology details etc. The integration testing design is carried out in the particular phase.\r\n\r\nModule design\r\nThe module design phase can also be referred to as low-level design. The designed system is broken up into smaller units or modules and each of them is explained so that the programmer can start coding directly. The low level design document or program specifications will contain a detailed functional logic of the module, in pseudocode:\r\n* database tables, with all elements, including their type and size\r\n* all interface details with complete API references\r\n* all dependency issues\r\n* error message listings\r\n* complete input and outputs for a module.\r\n\r\nThe unit test design is developed in this stage.\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/V-Model_(software_development)",
